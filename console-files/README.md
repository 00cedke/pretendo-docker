# Console files

This directly includes files that need to be copied to a console to help with the connection setup process, as well as
necessary dumps.

The program `ResetFriendsTestAccount.3dsx` was created by [Trace](https://github.com/TraceEntertains) (`traceentertains`
on Discord) and was originally shared in the Pretendo Network Discord server as `manual_override.3dsx`. **All credit for
this program goes to Trace.**
