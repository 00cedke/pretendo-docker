# Console files

These are files that need to be copied to a console and help with the connection setup process.

The program `ResetFriendsTestAccount.3dsx` was created by [Trace](https://github.com/TraceEntertains)
(`traceentertains` on Discord) and originally shared in the Pretendo Network Discord server as 
`manual_override.3dsx`. **All credit for it goes to him.**
