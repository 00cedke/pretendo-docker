# Environment variables

These files contain environment variables that are used by the containers. Each file is named after the container that
uses it and is specified in `compose.yml`. Keys that end in `.local.env` are ignored by Git, so they are used to store
secrets and are generated by `scripts/setup-environment.sh`.
