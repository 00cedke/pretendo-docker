# Cemu

This guide will show you how to access your server from the Cemu emulator.

## Connecting

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="wiiu" label="With a Wii U" default>
    1. Follow the [Wii U connecting guide](./wiiu.mdx) first.
    2. Follow the [official Pretendo Network Cemu installation guide](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu).
       - If you are using multiple accounts, make sure to disable the `Merge Account To Default Cemu User` setting in
         Dumpling.
    3. If you have not done so already, use Dumpling to dump your Friend List system application and any online games
       you want to play.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="no-wiiu" label="Without a Wii U">
    <Admonition type="warning">
      Prefer using the Wii U method if you have access to a Wii U console. This method is more complicated and requires
      using an account server patch that disables console verification, which normally blocks invalid OTP and SEEPROM
      dumps. **The fake OTP and SEEPROM dumps will not work on the official Pretendo server.**
    </Admonition>

    1. Run `./scripts/create-cemu-online-files.sh --fake-dumps <pnid>` to generate the necessary online files, including
       the `account.dat` and the fake dumps. Replace `<pnid>` with your PNID username, and enter the password when
       prompted.
       - If you already have another account in Cemu, you can use the `--persistent-id` option to change the persistent
         ID (like `80000001`) of the generated `account.dat` to one that is not already in use.
    2. Copy `otp.bin`, `seeprom.bin`, and `mlc01` from the created `online-files` directory to your Cemu directory.
       Merge the `mlc01` directory with your existing Cemu MLC directory if you have one.
    3. Continue with the [official Pretendo Network Cemu installation guide](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu)
       to enable online mode with Pretendo in the account settings.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, open the `settings.xml` file in your Cemu data directory and set the `<proxy_server>` value to
`http://server-ip:8080`, replacing `server-ip` with your server's IP address. Select your self-hosted PNID user in
Cemu's account settings.

Test your connection by opening the Friend List and making sure it connects successfully and shows your self-hosted PNID
username.
