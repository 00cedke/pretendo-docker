# Cemu

This guide will show you how to access your server from the Cemu emulator.

## Connecting

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="wiiu" label="With a Wii U" default>
    1. Follow the [Wii U connecting guide](./wiiu.mdx) first.
    2. Follow the [official Pretendo Network Cemu installation guide](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu).
       - If you are using multiple accounts, make sure to disable the `Merge Account To Default Cemu User` setting in
         Dumpling.
    3. If you have not done so already, use Dumpling to dump your Friend List system application and any online games
       you want to play.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="no-wiiu" label="Without a Wii U">
    <Admonition type="warning">
      Prefer using the Wii U method if you have access to a Wii U console. This method is more complicated and
      requires using an account server patch that disables the console verification, which normally blocks invalid OTP
      and SEEPROM dumps. **The fake OTP and SEEPROM dumps will not work on the official Pretendo server.**
    </Admonition>

    1. Follow the [browser connecting guide](./browser.mdx) first.
    2. Visit [the account settings page](https://pretendo.network/account) in your proxied browser and click the
       `Download account files` button.
       <Admonition type="info">
         This button will only show up on your server. This feature was purposefully disabled on the official Pretendo
         servers to prevent abuse and ban evasion.
       </Admonition>
    3. Copy `otp.bin`, `seeprom.bin`, and `mlc01` from the downloaded ZIP file to your Cemu directory.
    4. Continue with the [official Pretendo Network Cemu installation guide](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu)
       to enable online mode with Pretendo.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, open the `settings.xml` file in your Cemu data directory and set the `<proxy_server>` value to
`http://server-ip:8080`, replacing `server-ip` with your server's IP address. Select your self-hosted PNID user in
Cemu's account settings.

Test your connection by opening the Friend List and making sure it connects successfully and shows your self-hosted PNID
username.
