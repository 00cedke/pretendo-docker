# Web browser

This guide will show you how to access your server from your computer's web browser.

## Connecting

{/** Using an HTML list here is the simplest way to make the tabs display correctly inside the list. Mixing HTML/JSX and
Markdown block elements often causes unexpected results. **/}

<ol>
  <li>
    Create an isolated browser profile so you can safely MITM your browser. This is important because mitmproxy will
    intercept all traffic from your browser, potentially including passwords and other sensitive information. This also
    prevents irrelevant web browsing traffic from filling up the mitmproxy logs.

    <Tabs groupId="browsers">
      <TabItem value="chrome" label="Google Chrome">
        The easiest way to do this is to download [Chrome Dev](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/), which always uses a
        different browser profile than the stable version.

        Alternatively, if you only want to use the stable version of Chrome, you can use the
        [`--user-data-dir`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/user_data_dir.md#overriding-the-user-data-directory)
        flag to create an isolated user data directory. Chrome's "profiles" do not isolate network settings, so a
        separate user data directory is required.
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="firefox" label="Mozilla Firefox">
        The easiest way to do this is to download
        [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/), which always uses a different
        browser profile than the stable version.

        Alternatively, if you only want to use the stable version of Firefox, you can use the
        [profile manager](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles) to
        create an isolated profile.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

  </li>
  <li>
    Start your web browser using your server as a proxy server.

    <Tabs groupId="browsers">
      <TabItem value="chrome" label="Google Chrome">
        Using your isolated browser profile (either Chrome Dev or `--user-data-dir`), launch Chrome with the flag
        `--proxy-server="server-ip:8080"`, replacing `server-ip` with your server's IP address. Create a shortcut to
        your isolated Chrome profile with this flag to make it easier to open.
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="firefox" label="Mozilla Firefox">
        Using your isolated browser profile (either Firefox Developer Edition or the profile manager), go to `Settings
        => General => Network Settings => Settings...` and select `Manual proxy configuration`. Set the HTTP proxy to
        your server's IP address, the port to `8080`, and check `Also use this proxy for HTTPS`. Finally, click `OK`.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Then, visit [127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081) in any browser to view the mitmproxy logs and verify that
    traffic is going through mitmproxy.

  </li>
</ol>

:::tip

If you don't want to deal with the security warnings on every page from being MITMed, go to [mitm.it](http://mitm.it) in
your proxied browser and follow the instructions there to trust the mitmproxy certificate. This is secure because
mitmproxy generates a random certificate on first run, so nobody else could MITM your traffic except you.

:::

## Creating a test account

First, open [pretendo.network/account](https://pretendo.network/account) in your proxied browser.

:::warning

**Make sure that there is a big red banner stating "This is an unofficial Pretendo Network server!"** If there is not,
your proxy settings did not apply correctly, and you are connected to the official Pretendo Network server.

:::

Then, sign up for an account on the website, just as you would on the official Pretendo Network server. You can also
visit [juxt.pretendo.network](https://juxt.pretendo.network) in your proxied browser to view Juxt posts.

:::note

You can ignore the captcha: captcha verification is disabled in the account server.

:::

## Changing which server you are connected to

- To connect to your self-hosted Pretendo server, use your isolated web browser profile with the proxy settings to open
  the Pretendo Network website.
- To connect to the official Pretendo server, use your regular web browser without the proxy settings.
