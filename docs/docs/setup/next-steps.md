# Next Steps

1. Use `./scripts/make-pnid-dev.sh` to give your new PNID administrator permissions to the servers.
2. If you want to use Juxtaposition (Miiverse), use `./scripts/create-juxt-community.sh` to create a community (required

3. Read through the [containers information](../containers.md) to learn more about adminstering the servers.
