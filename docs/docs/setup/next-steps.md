# Next Steps

1. Use `./scripts/make-pnid-dev.sh` to give your new PNID(s) administrator permissions to the servers.
2. If you want to use Juxtaposition (Miiverse), use `./scripts/create-juxt-community.sh` to create some communities,
   which is required for posting.
3. Check out the scripts in the `scripts` directory. They do a bunch of useful things - run each one with the `-h` or
   `--help` flags to see what they do.
4. Read through the [containers information page](../containers.md) to learn more about adminstering the servers.
