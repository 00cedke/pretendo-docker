## Development

### Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

### Start a local development server

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

### Build the site

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.
